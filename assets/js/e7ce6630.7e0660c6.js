Although datasets collected using first-party annotation have important benefits, there is no comparison of human and machine performance on these new datasets. In this paper, we collect new annotations to provide human-level benchmarks for these first-party annotated sarcasm tasks in both English and Arabic, and compare the performance of human annotators to that of state-of-the-art sarcasm detection systems. Our analysis confirms that sarcasm detection is extremely challenging, with individual humans performing close to or slightly worse than the best trained models. With majority voting, however, humans are able to achieve the best results on all tasks. We also perform error analysis, finding that some of the most challenging examples are those that require additional context. We also highlight common features and patterns used to express sarcasm in English and Arabic such as idioms and proverbs. We suggest that to better capture sarcasm, future sarcasm detection datasets and models should focus on representing conversational and cultural context while leveraging world knowledge and common sense.\n    ".trim(),bib:"\n@inproceedings{abu-farha-etal-2022-sarcasm,\n    title = {Sarcasm Detection is Way Too Easy!

We argue that this traditional theory of sarcasm provides a grounding that is neither necessary, nor sufficient, for sarcasm to occur. Instead, we ground our generation process on a formal theory that specifies conditions that unambiguously differentiate sarcasm from non-sarcasm. Furthermore, Chandler not only generates sarcastic responses, but also explanations for why each response is sarcastic. This provides accountability, crucial for avoiding miscommunication between humans and conversational agents, particularly considering that sarcastic communication can be offensive.

Very large constellations of small, nano satellites\u2014 \u2019CubeSats\u2019 are a promising solution to reduce revisit time in disaster areas from days to hours. However, data transmission to ground receivers is limited by constraints on power and bandwidth of CubeSats. Onboard processing offers a solution to decrease the amount of data to transmit by reducing large sensor images to smaller data products. The ESA\u2019s recent PhiSat-1 mission aims to facilitate the demonstration of this concept, providing the hardware capability to perform onboard processing by including a power-constrained machine learning accelerator and the software to run custom applications. This work demonstrates a flood segmentation algorithm that produces flood masks to be transmitted instead of the raw images, while running efficiently on the accelerator aboard the PhiSat-1. Our models are trained on WorldFloods: a newly compiled dataset of 119 globally verified flooding events from disaster response organizations, which we make available in a common format.
